/**
 * API client — consolidated wrapper around lib/api/client.ts

 * so existing imports from "@/lib/api" keep working.
 *
 * The following type-only bindings are re-exported from @/types to avoid
 * duplication (they were historically defined inline in this file):
 *   - VendorNotificationPreferences
 *   - VendorAnalyticsPoint
 *   - VendorAnalyticsResponse
